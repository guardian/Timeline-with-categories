# Guardian timeline template

This is a timeline template that supports up to five filterable categories. [Live example here](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2015/oct/19/all-of-australias-national-security-changes-since-911-in-a-timeline).

To get started, copy the [template spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheets/d/13pP3qt2G2phdO1a06DhlgMKv6xvk_F9hiAPBGtRTV7s/edit?usp=sharing) and fill in your events. Keep the date format as dd/mm/yyyy (this will be modified for other date formats in the future)

Add the spreadsheet to the Guardian docs manager: [https://visuals.gutools.co.uk/docs/](https://visuals.gutools.co.uk/docs/) and publish.

Add the spreadsheet key to the end of this URL - http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/new-timeline/index.html?key=

eg. [http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/new-timeline/index.html?key=137nry7FMtHLOGN3S0SvhCMKH9crGJWKEwDUpS6qPaew](http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/new-timeline/index.html?key=137nry7FMtHLOGN3S0SvhCMKH9crGJWKEwDUpS6qPaew)
